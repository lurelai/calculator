# What it is?
This is a calculator made with HTML, CSS and JS

# What was the purpose?
The purpose is to put into practice and explore more what i learned about OOP/Js classes and JavaScript Maps like i said [here](https://github.com/lurelai/snake-game/edit/main/README.md)

# My conclusion
In general, I think I know enough about OOP. In the case of this application, I think I could have easily replaced the class created ("Calculator") with a simple object and there would have been no noticeable difference. From my point of view, class resources are fully utilized when there is a need to create more than one instance in the code (which was not the case), or in APIs, which generally need to have their resources naturally more organized.

# Next move
Now, I think that I will try to learn more about the backend and start with node.js

# Assessment
6/10 â‡¾ It was funny
